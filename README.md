# Color-Box-Jump

ColorJump is an engaging and vibrant game that combines creativity with strategy. 


In ColorJump, players input a number, and the game dynamically generates a grid of colored boxes corresponding to the multiplication of that number. 

As players select a box, it starts to change color, adding an element of excitement. 

The game offers two main modes: "Create" allows players to generate the colorful grid, while "Play" sets the grid in motion. 

In Play mode, colors jump from box to box, creating an exhilarating visual experience. Players must time their clicks strategically to catch the colors as they move across the grid. 


With each successful catch, the colors reset, and the challenge intensifies as players aim to reach the desired box. 


ColorJump offers endless entertainment with its dynamic gameplay and vibrant visuals. Get ready to immerse yourself in a world of colorful fun!
